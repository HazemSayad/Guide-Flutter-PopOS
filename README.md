# Guide-Flutter-PopOS
A guide on how I was able to make flutter doctor work on my pop os with Flatpak Android Studio

## My Setup
I have:
- Android Studio as Flatpak already installed
- I installed Flutter using snap
- I'm on Pop_OS

## Issues
After running `$ flutter doctor` I get the following:
```bash
Running "flutter pub get" in flutter_tools...                    2,601ms
Doctor summary (to see all details, run flutter doctor -v):
[‚úì] Flutter (Channel stable, 3.0.2, on Pop!_OS 21.10 5.17.11-xanmod1, locale en_US.UTF-8)

    ‚úó cmdline-tools component is missing
      Run `path/to/sdkmanager --install "cmdline-tools;latest"`

And for `$ flutter doctor -v`:

## My Fixes
NOTICE: THESE ARE MY FIXES, THEY MIGHT NOT APPLY TO YOU EXACTLY THE SAME AND THIS IS INTENTED TO HELP YOU FIGURE OUT THE PATTERNS. GOOD LUCK!

- For `Android Studio (not installed)` the solution was `$ flutter config --android-studio-dir=/home/hazem/.local/share/flatpak/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/android-studio`
```bash
[‚úì] Android Studio
    ‚Ä¢ Android Studio at /home/hazem/.local/share/flatpak/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/android-studio
    ‚Ä¢ Flutter plugin can be installed from:
      üî® https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9212-flutter
    ‚Ä¢ Dart plugin can be installed from:
      üî® https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6351-dart
    ‚Ä¢ android-studio-dir = /home/hazem/.local/share/flatpak/app/com.google.AndroidStudio/x86_64/stable/active/files/extra/android-studio
    ‚Ä¢ Java version OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.12+0-b1504.28-7817840)
```

- For the Android SDK, even though the log reports no issues with it, I was able to locate the correct path from the Android Studio Tools > SDK Manager
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94578938/173247131-3bec6d1a-577f-4fc5-8079-7df780b7e684.png)
    So I ran `$ flutter config --android-sdk=/home/hazem/Storage/Android/Sdk`

- For `‚úó cmdline-tools component is missing`, I downloaded *Command line tools only* from https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads Then I extracted the archive to downloads, went into the dir where `sdkmanager` executable is and ran this command to install cmdline-tools to the SDK dir from above `$ ./sdkmanager --sdk_root=/home/hazem/Storage/Android/Sdk "cmdline-tools;latest"`
-  Eventually you will have to run `$ flutter doctor --android-licenses` and type `y` and hit enter to accept licenses

## Result

`$ flutter doctor -v`:

I am missing chrome since I don't have it and won't use flutter to develop for web (as of writing this)
